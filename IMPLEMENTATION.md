## Features Implemented

### 1. Variable Cycle Duration (±15%)

**Problem:** Real washers don't run for exact programmed times. Load size, water temperature, and soil level cause natural variance of 10-20%.

**Solution:** 
- Mock socket now simulates ±15% realistic duration variance
- Profile matching tolerates up to ±25% variance (was ±50%)
- Better real-world detection accuracy, fewer false negatives

**Files Modified:**
- `devtools/mqtt_mock_socket.py` - Added `--variability` argument for realistic duration variance.
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/profile_store.py` - Updated duration tolerance and matching logic.

**How It Works (Duration Filter):**
```python
# Profile matching logic (Initial Filter)
duration_ratio = actual_duration / expected_duration
# Accepts if within range (default: 0.75 - 1.25)
# This prevents comparing apples to oranges (e.g. 30min vs 2h cycles)
```

**Testing:**
```bash
python3 devtools/mqtt_mock_socket.py --speedup 720 --default LONG
# Watch for: [VARIANCE] Applied ±X.X% duration variance
```

---

### 1b. Cycle Status Classification (✓/⚠/✗)

**Why:** Distinguish natural completions from abnormal endings and restarts.

**Statuses:**
- ✓ `completed` — Natural finish after `off_delay` in low-power wait.
- ✓ `force_stopped` — Watchdog finalized while already in low-power wait; treated as success.
- ✗ `interrupted` — Abnormal early end: very short run or abrupt power cliff that never recovers.
- ⚠ `resumed` — Active cycle restored after HA restart.

**Logic:**
- Detector tracks low-power window and elapsed time; `force_end()` maps to `completed` when low-power wait ≥ `off_delay`, else `force_stopped` and `_should_mark_interrupted` can reclassify short/abrupt runs.

**UI & Scoring:**
- ✓ cases are considered successful; ✗ is flagged as abnormal; ⚠ retains reduced confidence.

---

### 2. Progress Reset Logic (100% → 0%)

**Problem:** Progress stayed stuck at last calculated value when cycle ended; no clear completion signal or unload time tracking.

**Solution:**
- Progress reaches 100% immediately when cycle completes (clear signal)
- Progress stays at 100% for 5 minutes (user unload time)
- After 5 min idle, progress automatically resets to 0%
- If new cycle starts within 5 min, reset is cancelled

**Files Modified:**
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/manager.py` - Complete implementation

**State Flow:**
```
RUNNING → COMPLETE
    ↓
Progress = 100% (cycle finished)
Start 5-min idle timer
    ↓
[Scenarios]
├─ New cycle starts within 5min → Cancel reset, progress → 0%
└─ 5min passes with no activity → Progress → 0% (unload complete)
```

**Implementation Details:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `_cycle_completed_time` | Tracks when cycle finished (ISO timestamp) |
| `_progress_reset_delay` | Configurable idle time (default: 300s/5min) |
| `_start_state_expiry_timer()` | Begin countdown after cycle end |
| `_handle_state_expiry()` | Async callback checking if idle threshold passed |
| `_stop_state_expiry_timer()` | Cancel reset if new cycle starts |

**Entity Updates:**
```yaml
# During cycle (0-100%)
sensor.washer_progress: "45"

# Cycle ends
sensor.washer_progress: "100"

# After 5 min idle
sensor.washer_progress: "0"
```

---

### 3. Self-Learning Feedback System

**Problem:** System couldn't learn from users or improve over time; no transparency about why cycles were detected a certain way.

**Solution:**
- Emit feedback request events for high-confidence matches
- Accept user confirmations or corrections via service call
- Learn from corrections (update profile durations conservatively)
- Track all feedback for history and review

**Files Created:**
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/learning.py` (208 lines) - New LearningManager class

**Files Modified:**
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/manager.py` - Integrated learning
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/__init__.py` - Service handler
- `custom_components/ha_washdata/const.py` - Constants

#### Feedback Request Flow

When a cycle completes with high-confidence match:

```yaml
Event: ha_washdata_feedback_requested
Payload:
  cycle_id: "abc123xyz"
  detected_profile: "60°C Cotton"
  confidence: 0.75
  estimated_duration: 60  # minutes
  actual_duration: 62     # minutes
  is_close_match: true
  created_at: "2025-12-17T15:30:00+00:00"
```

#### User Confirmation

Call service to confirm detection was correct:

```yaml
service: ha_washdata.submit_cycle_feedback
data:
  entry_id: "integration_entry_id"
  cycle_id: "abc123xyz"
  user_confirmed: true
  notes: "Perfect detection"
```

#### User Correction

Correct if the detected program was wrong:

```yaml
service: ha_washdata.submit_cycle_feedback
data:
  entry_id: "integration_entry_id"
  cycle_id: "abc123xyz"
  user_confirmed: false
  corrected_profile: "40°C Delicate"
  corrected_duration: 3300  # seconds
  notes: "Was actually a delicate cycle"
```

#### Learning Algorithm

When user corrects a cycle:
1. Store correction in feedback history
2. Update the corrected profile's average duration
3. Use conservative weighting: **80% old + 20% new**
4. Mark cycle with `feedback_corrected: true`
5. Future matches use updated profile

**Example:**
```python
# Original profile average: 3600s (60 min)
# User correction: 3300s (55 min)
# New average = (3600 * 0.80) + (3300 * 0.20)
#             = 2880 + 660
#             = 3540s (59 min)  # Gradual adjustment
```

**Why 80/20?** Prevents overfitting to single corrections. System learns gradually from consistent feedback.

#### Accessing Feedback Data

**Get pending feedback:**
```python
manager.learning_manager.get_pending_feedback()
# Returns: {cycle_id: {feedback_data...}}
```

**Get feedback history:**
```python
manager.learning_manager.get_feedback_history(limit=10)
# Returns: [{feedback_record}, ...] sorted by date desc
```

**Get learning statistics:**
```python
manager.learning_manager.get_learning_stats()
# Returns: {
#   "total_feedback": 5,
#   "confirmations": 3,
#   "corrections": 2,
#   "pending": 0
# }
```

### 4. Export/Import with Full Settings Transfer

**Problem:** Users needed to manually reconfigure all settings when setting up multiple devices or migrating to new instances.

**Solution:**
- Export all cycles, profiles, feedback history, AND all fine-tuned settings as JSON
- Import via UI (copy/paste, no filesystem needed) or file-based service
- Automatic orphaned profile cleanup during import
- Per-device isolation maintained via entry_id

**Files Modified:**
- `profile_store.py` - `export_data(entry_data, entry_options)`, `async_import_data(payload)` now handle config
- `config_flow.py` - New `async_step_export_import()` with JSON textarea
- `__init__.py` - Services updated to pass entry.data/options to export/import
- `strings.json` & `translations/en.json` - New UI labels and descriptions

**What's exported:**
```python
{
  "version": STORAGE_VERSION,
  "entry_id": "unique_id",
  "exported_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "data": {
    "profiles": {...},
    "past_cycles": [...],
    "feedback_history": [...]
  },
  "entry_data": {
    # power_sensor, name (device-specific - NOT imported)
  },
  "entry_options": {
    # ALL fine-tuned settings: min_power, off_delay, learning_confidence, etc.
  }
}
```

**UI Access:**
- Options → Diagnostics → Export/Import JSON
- Select "Export only" to copy JSON
- Select "Import from JSON" to paste exported data
- All settings automatically applied on import

**Service Usage:**
```yaml
service: ha_washdata.export_config
data:
  device_id: "washer_device_id"
  path: "/config/ha_washdata_export.json"

service: ha_washdata.import_config
data:
  device_id: "washer_device_id"
  path: "/config/ha_washdata_export.json"
```

### 5. Auto-Maintenance Watchdog

**Problem:** Deleted cycles left orphaned profile labels; fragmented runs cluttered history.

**Solution:**
- Nightly cleanup at midnight (configurable via switch)
- Removes profiles referencing deleted cycles
- Merges fragmented cycles (last 24h, max 30min gaps)
- Logs maintenance statistics
- User can toggle on/off via `switch.<name>_auto_maintenance`

**Files Created:**
- `switch.py` - New AutoMaintenanceSwitch entity (mdi:broom icon)

**Files Modified:**
- `profile_store.py`:
  - `cleanup_orphaned_profiles()` - Remove profiles with dead cycle references
  - `async_run_maintenance(lookback_hours, gap_seconds)` - Full maintenance run
- `manager.py`:
  - `_setup_maintenance_scheduler()` - Schedule midnight task
  - `_remove_maintenance_scheduler` - Cancel scheduler
  - Enhanced `async_shutdown()` to clean up scheduler
- `const.py` - Added `CONF_AUTO_MAINTENANCE`, `DEFAULT_AUTO_MAINTENANCE=True`
- `__init__.py` - Registered Switch platform

**Maintenance Workflow:**
```
Daily at 00:00
    ↓
ProfileStore.async_run_maintenance()
    ├─ 1. cleanup_orphaned_profiles()
    │  └─ Remove profiles referencing non-existent cycles
    ├─ 2. merge_cycles(lookback_hours=24, gap_seconds=1800)
    │  └─ Merge fragmented runs from past 24h (≤30min gaps)
    └─ 3. Save and log stats
```

**Switch Entity:**
- `switch.<name>_auto_maintenance` (default: ON)
- Toggle to enable/disable nightly cleanup
- When toggled, scheduler is re-setup accordingly
- Toggling OFF cancels scheduled cleanup

### 6. Robust Cycle State Machine (vNext)

**Problem:** Simple ON/OFF logic failed with pauses, soaking, or "Anti-Crease" modes.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a formal State Machine: `OFF` -> `STARTING` -> `RUNNING` <-> `PAUSED` -> `ENDING` -> `OFF`.
- **OFF**: Monitoring for `min_power`.
- **STARTING**: Debounce phase. Requires `start_duration_threshold` AND `start_energy_threshold` (e.g. 5Wh) to confirm.
- **RUNNING**: Main active state.
- **PAUSED**: Entered if power drops low but not long enough to end. Allows for soaking or door opening.
- **ENDING**: Candidates for completion. Must satisfy `off_delay` AND `end_energy_threshold` (e.g. < 50Wh in last window) to finish.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates false starts from brief spikes.
- Prevents false endings during long pauses if energy was high recently.
- Handles "Anti-Crease" (periodic tumbles) gracefully via `PAUSED`/`ENDING` transitions.

### 7. Reliability Features

**Goal:** Improve precision for similar cycles and reduce "stuck" time estimates.

#### A. Confidence Boosting (Shape Matching)
**Problem:** Cycles with identical duration but different phases (e.g. Eco vs Intensive) were hard to distinguish.
**Solution:** If `numpy.corrcoef` > 0.85 (very strong shape match), the profile match score is heavily boosted (x1.2), allowing strict shape matching to override minor power amplitude differences.

#### B. Smart Time Prediction (Variance Locking)
**Problem:** Time remaining jumped erratically during variable phases (e.g. heating water).
**Solution:**
- System calculates standard deviation (variance) of the matched profile window.
- If variance is high (>50W std dev): Time estimate updates are **damped** (locked).
- If variance is low: Time estimate updates normally.
- **Switching Logic (Match Persistence)**: To prevent "flapping" between profiles or between a profile and "detecting...", the system enforces temporal persistence:
    - **Initial Match**: Requires 3 consecutive matching attempts before switching from "detecting..." to a specific profile.
    - **Unmatching**: Requires 3 consecutive attempts with confidence below the `unmatch_threshold` before reverting to "detecting...".
    - **Mid-Cycle Override**: Requires 3 consecutive attempts AND a minimum confidence gap of **0.15** (High Confidence) or **0.05** (Positive Trend) to switch between different profiles.
- **Divergence Detection**: Implemented a "Score-Drop" check to handle cycles that start similar but diverge later. If the current matching confidence falls below a configured ratio (default 40% drop) of the peak score recorded for that cycle, the manager automatically reverts to "Detecting...". This prevents the integration from staying locked to an incorrect long profile when a shorter one ends.
 
#### C. Smart Termination & End Spike Logic
**Problem:** Dishwashers often have a long silent drying phase followed by a brief, high-power pump-out spike. Smart termination would sometimes cut the cycle off early (during drying), missing the final spike and causing the spike to trigger a new "ghost" cycle.

**Solution:**
- **Conservative Ratio**: Dishwashers require **99%** of expected duration before Smart Termination is even considered (vs 98% for others).
- **End Spike Wait Period**: Even if the duration is met, the system scans the "Ending" state for a high-power spike.
- If no spike is found, it **waits up to 5 extra minutes** past the expected duration to catch it.
- **Ghost Cycle Suppression**: A "Suspicious Window" (20 mins) protects legitimate short cycles. Aggressive ghost cycle termination (10 min timeout) only applies if a cycle starts within 20 mins of the previous one ending.
- **Persistence**: This 20-minute window logic persists across Home Assistant restarts by restoring `_last_cycle_end_time` from the persistent `profile_store`, ensuring protection isn't lost after a reboot.
- **Tail Preservation**: The profile store now explicitly preserves trailing silence/spikes for natural completions, preventing the "profile shrinking" feedback loop where frequent early terminations made the learned profile shorter and shorter.
- **Strict Deferral**: To prevent termination hangs on mismatched profiles, the "Deferred Finish" logic now requires either a `verified_pause` (confirmed by profile envelope alignment) or high match confidence (default > 0.55).
 
#### D. Zombie Protection & Stuck Power Prevention
**Problem:** Power sensors could become "stuck" at non-zero values if a smart plug failed to push the final 0W update. Conversely, long pauses in dishwashers (e.g. drying) could trigger a watchdog kill, prematurely ending a legitimate cycle.

**Solution:**
- **Profile-Aware Watchdog**: The watchdog now checks the `expected_duration` from the matched profile. If the cycle is currently within its expected runtime (even if silent for > 60 mins), the watchdog automatically extends the timeout.
- **Verified Pause Support**: For devices like dishwashers with multi-hour silent drying phases, the watchdog detects a `verified_pause` (via profile alignment). When active, the timeout is extended to **DEFAULT_MAX_DEFERRAL_SECONDS** (2 hours) plus a 30-minute buffer, ensuring the cycle is not killed even if it exceeds its original expected duration during the pause.
- **Zombie Killer (Hard Limit)**: To prevent runaway "ghost" cycles, a hard termination limit is enforced at **200%** of the expected profile duration (minimum 2 hours).
- **Stuck Power Reset**: When the watchdog or detector forces a cycle to end (due to timeout or manual stop), the `current_power` state is explicitly reset to **0.0W**, ensuring Home Assistant entities reflect reality even if the hardware sensor fails to report the final drop.
- **Low-Power Bypass**: Power readings below `min_power` now bypass all debouncing, smoothing, and throttling filters in `manager.py`, ensuring the "cycle end" signal is processed with zero latency.

## Recent Test Expansion Findings (2026-02-04)

During the expansion of the test suite (Phase 4), several minor issues and areas for improvement were identified:

1.  **ProfileStore.async_import_data Return Value**: The method signature indicates -> dict[str, Any], but the implementation currently returns None. Tests have been adjusted to ignore the return value for now.
2.  **CycleDetector Minimum Samples for Matching**: The matching logic requires at least 12 samples after resampling. Highly irregular data with large gaps (e.g., 250s) can lead to failed matches if the total cycle duration is short, even if the "shape" is recognizable.
3.  **Timezone Sensitivity in decompress_power_data**: The isoformat() conversion in decompress_power_data uses datetime.fromtimestamp(ts) which defaults to local time. This can cause mismatches in tests comparing against UTC strings. Using dt_util.utc_from_timestamp or always using aware datetimes is recommended.
4.  **ProfileStore.delete_cycle is Async**: Some older test code or assumptions might treat it as sync. It MUST be awaited as it triggers async_rebuild_envelope and async_save.

### 8. Device Type Specifics

The integration includes specialized handling for different appliance types to account for their unique power profiles:

- **Washing Machine**: Standard defaults; handles repeating wash/rinse phases.
- **Dryer**: More linear power curve; shorter pauses.
- **Dishwasher**: Multi-hour silent drying phases; end pump-out spikes; requires multi-hour watchdog extensions and conservative smart termination.
- **Electric Vehicle (EV)**: High-power charging cycles; supports "Charging" and "Maintenance" phase heuristics; 15-minute off-gap to handle brief charger disconnections.
- **Coffee Machine**: Very short cycles; rapid sampling requirements.
