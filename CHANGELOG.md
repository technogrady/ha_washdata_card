# Changelog

All notable changes to HA WashData will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.2.1] - 2026-02-13

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Manual Recording Trimming**: Fixed a bug where manual recordings (e.g., Dishwashers in Eco mode) were internally shortened by incorrectly snapping the cycle duration to the last recorded power reading, losing trailing silence like drying phases.
- **Profile Statistics Accuracy**: Corrected profile duration calculations to use the authoritative cycle duration instead of data-offset bounds. This fixes incorrect remaining-time predictions and profile "shrinkage" over time.
- **Aggressive Tail Trimming**: Modified recorder suggestions to be less aggressive. Suggested tail trims are now `0.0` for silence periods under 10 minutes, protecting legitimate silent phases in appliances.
- **Data Optimization Logic**: Fixed maintenance logic that was incorrectly snapping durations to the last power reading during start-time shift corrections.
- **Envelope Reconstruction**: Updated the statistical engine to correctly respect explicit cycle durations even when power sensor updates are sparse or missing at the end of a run.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-11

### ✨ Features
- **Advanced Parameter Auto-Suggestion**:
  - New `SuggestionEngine` that analyzes your appliance's actual power traces to recommend optimal settings.
  - Automatically suggests values for `start_threshold_w`, `off_delay`, `watchdog_interval`, and more based on observed behavior.
  - Periodic background optimization to keep settings tuned as your appliance ages or use patterns change.
- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Support**:
  - Added new "Electric Vehicle" device type with optimized defaults.
  - New icons and phase heuristics ("Charging", "Maintenance").
- **Divergence Detection**:
  - Improved matching logic to detect when a cycle starts diverging from its matched profile.
  - Automatically reverts to "Detecting..." if confidence drops significantly below the cycle's peak (default 40% drop).
- **Card Animation**:
  - Added native spinning animation to the dashboard card icon when the appliance is running.
- **Configurable Stability Thresholds**:
  - Added `DEFAULT_MATCH_REVERT_RATIO` and `DEFAULT_DEFER_FINISH_CONFIDENCE` to `const.py` for easier fine-tuning.
- **Profile-Aware Watchdog**:
  - The watchdog now uses "look-ahead" logic from the matched profile to prevent premature cycle termination during long legitimate pauses (e.g., dishwasher drying).
  - Automatically extends silence timeouts if the cycle is within its expected profile duration.
- **Zombie Protection**:
  - Implemented a hard "Zombie Killer" limit that force-ends cycles exceeding 200% of their expected profile duration (min 2 hours).
- **Stuck Power Prevention**:
  - Automatically resets the power sensor to 0W when a cycle is forced to end by the watchdog or manual stop, fixing issues where the entity remained at a high value.
- **Zero-Latency Low-Power Processing**:
  - Power updates below `min_power` now bypass all debouncing, smoothing, and sampling interval filters, ensuring immediate cycle-end detection.
- **Program Detection Stability**:
  - Implemented temporal persistence for profile matching: requires 3 consecutive consistent matches before switching from "detecting..." to a profile, or before unmatching a profile.
  - Added a minimum confidence gap for mid-cycle profile switching to prevent "flapping" between similar programs.
- **Total Duration Sensor**:
  - New `total_duration` sensor providing the predicted total cycle time (Elapsed + Remaining).
  - Designed specifically to support full progress bars in `timer-bar-card`.
  - Dynamically updates as estimates are refined.

### 🛠️ Improvements
- **Manual Recording Robustness**:
  - Increased gap threshold to 6 hours to support very long Eco cycles with multi-hour silent phases.
  - Unified automatic trimming threshold to 1.0W across the integration.
- **Clean Card UI**:
  - Removed redundant "off" label from completion details when the appliance is inactive.
- **Zigbee2MQTT Guidance**:
  - Added optimized configuration tips for Z2M smart plug users in README.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Profile Alignment Error (#112)**:
  - Fixed a critical `TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable` in the profile matching pipeline.
- **Terminal State Persistence**:
  - Fixed a bug where `finished` and `interrupted` states were not resetting to `off` after the intended 30-minute timeout.
- **Profile Shrinking**:
  - Fixed an issue where maintenance tasks would aggressively trim trailing silence from completed cycles, causing profiles to shorten over time.
- **Termination Hangs**:
  - Restricted "Deferred Finish" logic to require high confidence (> 0.55) or a verified pause, preventing cycles from hanging on mismatched long profiles.
- **Long Drying Phase Support**:
  - Fixed an issue where dishwashers with multi-hour silent drying phases were being split into multiple cycles by the watchdog.
  - Recognizes "Verified Pause" from profile envelope to extend silence timeouts.
- **Test Stability**:
  - Resolved several `TypeError` issues in the test suite and improved mocking reliability for sensors and configs.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-03

### ✨ Features
- **Persistent Terminal States**:
  - Implemented proper `finished`, `interrupted`, and `force_stopped` states that persist for 30 minutes after cycle completion.
  - Improves visibility of cycle outcomes in the UI (users can now see "Finished" instead of just "Off").
  - Auto-resets to `off` after 30 minutes, or immediately if a new cycle starts.
- **Coffee Machine Defaults**: Added dedicated defaults for coffee machines (faster sampling, shorter timeouts) to improve detection out-of-the-box.
- **French Translation**: Added full French localization (thanks to @MaximeNagel).

### 🛠️ Improvements
- **Profile Sorting**: Improved sorting for profile lists (natural sort), ensuring correct numeric order (e.g. `1, 2, 10` instead of `1, 10, 2`).
- **Refactored Device Defaults**: Consolidated and cleaned up device-specific default settings logic.
- **Test Suite**: Enhanced test coverage for cycle state transitions and manager notifications.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Stuck Power Value**: Fixed issue where the power entity would get stuck at the last non-zero value after a cycle ended.
- **Timezone Display**: Fixed issue where timestamps in specific UI menus were shown in GMT instead of local time.
- **Advanced Settings Error**: Fixed a crash that prevented advanced settings from being saved in the configuration flow.
- **State Logic**: Fixed assertions and logic validation for terminal states.
- **Notification Tests**: Fixed test environment formatting for notification services.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-12

**Major Architectural Rewrite ("vNext")**

This release marks a complete re-engineering of the HA WashData core, transitioning from simple heuristics to a rigorous signal processing pipeline and robust state machine. While the version number is minor, this is effectively a new engine under the hood.

🎉 **Milestones Reached!**
- HA WashData is now available in the **HACS Default Repository**!
- Passed **1,000 active installations** across the community.
- Reached **500+ stars** on GitHub.

Thank you to everyone who has been patient during development and to all contributors who provided invaluable feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions. This release wouldn't be possible without you!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Fresh Start Recommended**
> 
> This release includes significant changes to how cycles are detected and profiles are matched. The new engine depends on **clean, accurate data** to work properly.
> 
> If you're unsure whether your previously recorded cycles were captured correctly (e.g., cycles that ended prematurely, incorrectly merged fragments, or noisy data from before tuning your thresholds), we recommend:
> 1. **Delete your existing cycle history** via Configure → Manage Cycles → Delete All
> 2. **Use the new "Record Cycle" feature** to capture fresh, clean training data for each program you use
> 
> This ensures the best possible matching accuracy with the new architecture.


### Core Architecture: Signal Processing & State Machine
- **New Signal Processing Engine** (`signal_processing.py`):
  - **Dt-Aware Integration**: Replaced simple averaging with trapezoidal Riemann sum integration (`integrate_wh`) that respects variable sampling intervals.
  - **Robust Smoothing**: Implemented `robust_smooth`, a hybrid algorithm combining a Median Filter (spike rejection) with a Time-Aware Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for clean trend detection.
  - **Adaptive Resampling**: New primitives (`resample_adaptive`, `resample_uniform`) handle irregular sensor updates and enforce strict gap handling (no interpolation across large gaps).
  - **Idle Baseline Learning**: Automatically learns the device's "true zero" using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), removing the need for manual calibration.

- **Finite State Machine (FSM)**:
  - Replaced binary ON/OFF logic with a formal FSM: `OFF` → `STARTING` → `RUNNING` ↔ `PAUSED` → `ENDING` → `OFF`.
  - **Dt-Aware Gating**: Start/End detection now uses accumulated time/energy gates (e.g., "energy since idle > X Wh") rather than sample counts, making it immune to sensor update frequency.
  - **Smart Pausing**: Distinguishes between "End of Cycle" and "Mid-Cycle Pause" using dynamic thresholds derived from the sensor's sampling cadence (`_p95_dt`).

### Storage v2 & Migration
- **Profile Store v2** (`profile_store.py`):
  - **New Schema**: Introduced a versioned storage schema (v2) optimized for performance.
  - **Trace Compression**: Historical power traces are now compressed using relative time deltas, significantly reducing disk usage.
  - **Robust Migration**: Included a designated `WashDataStore` engine that automatically upgrades v1 data to v2 without data loss, preserving user labels and corrections.

### ✨ functionality & Features
- **Configurable Sampling Interval**: New "Sampling Interval" setting allows users to throttle high-frequency sensors (e.g., 1s updates) to reduce CPU load.
- **Precision Configuration**: Configuration flow now uses **Text Box** inputs for all numeric thresholds, offering precise control over parameters like `start_energy_threshold` (Wh) and `drop_ratio`.
- **Smart Resume**: "Resurrection" logic restores the exact cycle state (including sub-state) after a Home Assistant restart.
- **Auto-Labeling**: Increased default confidence threshold to **0.75** (from 0.70) to leverage the improved accuracy of the new engine.
- **Diagnostic Sensors**: Added dynamic diagnostic sensors for each profile (e.g., `sensor.washdata_..._profile_cotton_count`) showing the total cycle count properly.
- **Statistics**: Added "Total Energy" column to the Profile Statistics table, showing the cumulative energy consumed for each profile.
- **Low-Rate Polling Support**: Optimized default settings for devices with 30-60s update intervals (e.g., Shelly Cloud, Tuya), including a 30s watchdog and 180s off-delay.
- **User Experience**: moved "Review Learned Feedbacks" to the main menu (bottom) for easier access, and removed confusing options.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Logging**: Added more granular `termination_reason` logging (e.g., `smart`, `timeout`, `force_stopped`) to `cycle_detector` and `profile_store`.
- **Timezone Robustness**: Complete refactor to use timezone-aware datetimes (`dt_util.now()`) exclusively, permanently fixing "offset-naive/offset-aware" comparison errors.
- **Strict Typing**: Codebase now strictly adheres to type hinting, with extensive use of `TypeAlias` and `dataclass` for internal structures.
- **Performance**: Optimized `last_match_details` sensor attribute to exclude large raw data arrays, preventing Home Assistant state update bloat.
- **Serialization**: Fixed `MatchResult` JSON serialization issues that were blocking sensor updates.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Premature Termination & Dishwasher Logic**: Major robustness improvements for dishwashers.
  - Implemented "Verified Pause" logic to prevent early termination during long drying phases.
  - Added "End Spike Wait Period": Dishwashers now wait up to 5 extra minutes after expected duration to capture final pump-out spikes.
  - Increased Smart Termination duration ratio to **0.99** (from 96%) to ensure strictly conservative termination for dishwashers.
- **Ghost Cycles**: Enhanced filtering and elimination of false detection.
  - **Persistent Suppression**: The "Suspicious Window" (20 min) now persists across restarts (restoring `last_cycle_end`), preventing end-spikes from triggering ghosts after reboots.
  - **Tail Preservation**: Disabled "zero trimming" for confirmed completed cycles, preventing the "profile shrinking" feedback loop where tails were lost.
  - Implemented `completion_min_seconds` logic to ignore brief spikes.
- **Start/End Flutter**: Start debounce and End repeat counts are now configurable and backed by robust accumulators, eliminating false starts/ends.
- **Cycle Detector**: Adjusted duration validation logic to strict 90%-125% window for completion.
- **Translations**: Fixed "intl string context variable not provided" errors in logs by properly passing placeholders to translation engine.
- **Debug Sensors**: Fixed "Top Candidates" sensor showing "None" due to missing data propagation.
- **Code Quality**: Addressed various linting issues (indentation, whitespace, unused arguments).
- **Crash Fixes**: Resolved `UnboundLocalError` and specific edge-case crashes in `profile_store.py` during migration.
- **Critical Fix (Runtime Matching)**: Fixed an issue where runtime profile matching was blocking the event loop and skipping DTW; now uses the full async pipeline.
- **Legacy Data Repair**: Added automatic reconstruction of missing `time_grid` in old profile envelopes to prevent errors.
- **Validation**: Fixed missing `dtw_bandwidth` key in `strings.json` causing config flow validation errors.
- **Maintenance Safety**: Fixed aggressive cleanup logic that was deleting empty/new profiles (pending training); these are now safely preserved.
- **Test Suite**: Fixed verification tests for Smart Termination and Profile Store matching.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Visual Settings Guide**: Expanded `SETTINGS_VISUALIZED.md` with comprehensive documentation for 20+ parameters, organized into logical sections (Signal Conditioning, Detection, Matching, Integrity, Interruption, Learning, Notifications).
- **Complete Parameter Coverage**: All advanced settings now documented with explanations, including `sampling_interval`, `watchdog_interval`, `profile_match_threshold`, `duration_tolerance`, `learning_confidence`, `auto_label_confidence`, and `abrupt_drop_ratio`.

### 🧹 Cleanup & Removals
- **Removed `auto_merge_gap_seconds`**: This setting was never used in the actual merge logic; removed from code, config flow, and translations.
- **Removed `auto_merge_lookback_hours`**: Similar unused legacy setting removed from codebase and UI.
- **Fixed Unused Imports**: Cleaned up unused `DEFAULT_PROFILE_MATCH_MAX_DURATION_RATIO` and duplicate import warnings.
- **Fixed F-String Warning**: Removed empty f-string in config_flow post-process step.

### ⚠️ Deprecations
- **Legacy Logic**: Removed "consecutive samples" based detection in favor of time-aware accumulators.
- **Sliders**: Removed slider inputs in config flow in favor of precise text inputs.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Manual Control**: "Force End Cycle" button to manually terminate stuck cycles (treats as "Completed" and saves data).
- **Reliability**: "Cycle Resurrection" logic to restore active cycle state after Home Assistant restarts.
- **Reliability**: "Smart Resume" estimation to provide progress updates during "detecting..." phase based on historical averages.
- **Smart Cycle Extension**: New feature to prevent premature cycle termination during long low-power phases (e.g., dishwasher drying).
- **Statistics**: Energy (kWh) estimates added to Profile Statistics table.
- **UI**: Added legends to profile graphs and scaled them up by 50% for better readability.
- **Config Flow**: Split "Manage Data" into "Manage Cycles" and "Manage Profiles" menus for better usability.

- **Onboarding First Profile Step**: New users are now prompted to optionally create their first profile immediately after setting up the device, streamlining the initial experience.
- **Automatic Recalculation**: Deleting a cycle now automatically triggers a recalculation of the associated profile's statistical envelope, ensuring accurate estimates even after cleaning up bad data.

### Fixed
- **Translations**: Fixed missing text labels in the "Create Profile" modal and Onboarding flow.
- **Configuration Flow**: Resolved `AttributeError: _get_schema` in the initial setup step.
- **Mocking Issues**: Improved test verification process for Config Flow.
- **Manual Override**: Fixed issue where unselecting a manual profile while idle would not clear the program sensor.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-31

- **Start Duration Threshold**: Now configurable in advanced settings (previously hard-coded)

#### Advanced Cycle Detection
New logic to handle tricky appliances and prevent false detections:
- **Start Debounce Filtering**: Configurable debounce period to ignore brief power spikes before confirming cycle start
- **Running Dead Zone**: A new setting to ignore power dips during the first few seconds of a cycle (useful for machines that pause shortly after starting)
- **End Repeat Count**: Requires the "Off" condition to be met multiple times consecutively before finishing a cycle, preventing false cycle ends during long pauses/soaking
- **Ghost Cycle Prevention**: Added `completion_min_seconds` to filter out short "noise" cycles from being recorded as completed
- **Device Type Configuration**: Support for multiple appliance types (washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, coffee machine) with device-type-aware progress smoothing thresholds

#### Smoother Estimation Engine
